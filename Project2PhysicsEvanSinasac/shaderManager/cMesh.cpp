//				Mesh/model information.  Given to us by Michael Feeney.  Removed the boolean for bIsWireframe as it is handled by a
//				single boolean in theMain.cpp that is dependent on the user pressing the space key to toggle.
//				Changes will continue to be made here depending on how we're doing lighting and things, not fully sure yet.
